A 3D online multiplayer humans vs. zombies game (basically, online tag). Uses
three.js for rendering, WebSockets for peer discovery/matchmaking, and WebRTC
DataChannels (via PeerJS) for input/game state communication.

Despite using WebRTC, the game uses a client-server model, where the game
server is the authority on what the current state of the game is. However,
because the game server uses WebRTC, it must also be run in a browser
(node-webrtc is a node-only implementation of WebRTC, but I'm not sure how
stable it is, and PeerJS wouldn't be able to work with it, anyway). When a new
game is started, the matchmaking server spawns a headless chromium process
using xvfb to create a fake screen for the chrome browser to run in.
